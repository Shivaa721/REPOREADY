# REPOREADY

**REPOREADY** is an AI-powered tool that helps developers automatically generate professional README files. Users can provide a code file or paste code directly, and REPOREADY creates a structured, ready-to-use README in seconds, saving time and ensuring consistency across projects.

The project has two main parts:

* **frontend** – Built with React for the user interface
* **backend** – Node.js/Express server that handles AI processing and README generation

---

## Features

* Automatically generate professional README files from code files or pasted code.
* Clean, structured documentation output.
* Easy setup for both frontend and backend.
